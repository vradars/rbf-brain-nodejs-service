                give permission for their participation in the study, and we may ask them to agree (give assent) to take
                part. Throughout the consent form, “you” always refers to the person who takes part in the research

                            We are asking you to be in this research because we want to understand more about head
                            acceleration events in sports and more broadly how engineering might improve safety for players.
                            This research is being done to find out if the combination of sports sensors and modeling can help us
                            understand head acceleration events better.
                            This study may enroll up to 500 athletes and non-athletes.
                            The data obtained from this study could provide potentially useful information for the quantitative
                            diagnosis of brain injury. However, this technology can make no formal diagnosis at this time and does
                            not claim to be a diagnostic tool. Subjects are directed to a medical professional for a formal diagnosis
                            of injury.

                            In this research subjects will be asked to wear the impact sensors. The impact sensors monitor/record every
                            significant incidence of head impact (single or multiple impacts) sustained during the game or practice. They
                            measure the magnitude (both linear and rotational acceleration), location, direction and duration as well as
                            the exact time of each impact. Subjects may also be asked to get an MRI scan at the beginning of season and
                            after the subject experienced concussion. Also note the following items:

                                physician who can provide a medically acceptable comparison. If a concussion or mild traumatic brain

                                        scan would last about 1 hour, so an estimated 2 hours plus travel time would be required.
